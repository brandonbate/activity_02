<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->

<!-- This is an HTML declaration. It tells the brower that this document
is indeed an HTML document. This is important to include if your file
does not end in .html or .htm. But even if your document ends with these
extensions, it's a good practie to include it regardless. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- All HTML documents begin an <html> tag and end with an </html>
tag. If you've never seen HTML before, stop what you're doing and
read this: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp 
The above web page gives a nice overview of the overall structure
of HTML and explains the purpose of many of the tags that follow. -->
<html>
<head>
	<!-- This gives the title on the tab for this web page -->
	<title>Boring Title</title>

	<!-- Text characters are encoded in a variety of formats. This
	tells the web browser the character encoding we're using. You
	can get away without including this, but it is a good  practice. -->
	<meta charset="utf-8"> 
	
	<!-- This tag enables browsers to appropriately resize our
	web content on small screens. If you are interested, you can
	read more about this at:

	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
	
	<!-- In a word processor, the content you write (i.e. words) and
	the display style (font, font size, etc.) are inextricably linked.
	Not so with web content. An HTML document contains contains content
	nested within tags. The display properties of the tags are specified
	in a cascading style sheet (CSS) file. This "link" tag tells the
	browser to use my_page.css to determine the display styles for our
	various tags. -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="my_page.css">
</head>

<body>

<!-- In this HTML file I'm using "semantic elements". These
elements include the following tags: <header>, <nav>, <section>,
<article>, <aside> and <footer>. You should think of these tags
as creating blocks for HTML content on our web page. I have display
properties defined in my_page.css, but without these properties
defined, these tags basically do nothing. To see that this is the
case, you can try commenting out the above "link" tag and see what
happens. To fully appreciate how this web page is displayed, you will
need to read through my_page.css. But finish reading through this
file before you do. -->

<header>
	<!-- The h2 tag specifies a heading for a document. A heading is
	like the title for a page. There are many different heading "sizes",
	which good web developers specify in CSS. Read more about heading
	tags at:

	<h2>Boring Heading</h2>
</header>

<nav>
	<!-- The anchor tag <a> allows you to create links to other web pages.
